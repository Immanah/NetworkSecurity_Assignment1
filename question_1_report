1.1.	Proposed Network Topology Solution for Enhanced Performance and Scalability
To address the network congestion and limitations associated with TechNet Solutions’ current bus topology, adopting a star topology for the central office network would be ideal. In a star configuration, each device connects directly to a central switch, which routes all communications, allowing for significant improvements over a bus topology where devices share a single data pathway. This setup greatly reduces congestion, as each device has its own dedicated connection to the central hub, thus enabling faster and more efficient data transfer. By using this topology, TechNet Solutions can avoid the latency issues common in bus networks, especially in a network environment supporting 200 employees (Mocanu et al., 2020).

In addition, the scalability of star topology aligns well with TechNet Solutions’ rapid growth needs. This setup allows new devices to be added simply by connecting them to the central switch, without the need to disrupt or reconfigure the existing network structure. For an expanding company like TechNet Solutions, this adaptability is essential for future-proofing the network. This topology’s modularity can accommodate expansion in both the number of users and devices, making it a sustainable choice for scaling network operations (Srivastava et al., 2019).

Another crucial benefit of star topology is its fault tolerance. Unlike bus topology, where a single cable failure can disable the entire network, star topology localizes failures to individual device connections. This setup ensures that if one device or link experiences a malfunction, the rest of the network remains unaffected and operational (Abu et al., 2018). For TechNet Solutions, this resilience is invaluable, as uninterrupted network performance is critical to maintaining their IT support services for clients. Thus, adopting a star topology offers both increased reliability and minimized risk of downtime.

Ultimately, adopting a star topology offers TechNet Solutions a strategic solution that addresses their immediate performance concerns while positioning the network for sustainable, long-term growth. By reducing congestion, this topology improves the current network’s efficiency, and its scalable design ensures seamless integration of new devices as the company expands. The enhanced fault tolerance also minimizes risks of network-wide failures, providing the reliability necessary for continuous client support. Together, these benefits make the star topology an ideal choice for a robust and future-proof network redesign.

1.2. Optimizing Routing Efficiency through Dynamic Protocols: A Comparison of OSPF and EIGRP
Dynamic routing protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), are essential tools for improving network efficiency by enabling routers to automatically adjust to shifts in network structure. Unlike static routing, which requires manual route configuration, dynamic protocols continuously evaluate the network’s topology to identify optimal paths for data transmission. This capability is particularly beneficial for TechNet Solutions, as it ensures efficient, reliable data flow across the company's multiple branches, adapting in real-time to network changes and supporting seamless connectivity.

Dynamic routing protocols empower routers to autonomously determine the most efficient path for data packets, eliminating the need for manual route configuration with each change in the network. This automation significantly reduces the administrative workload involved in maintaining an extensive network, as it continuously updates and recalculates optimal routes, ensuring that the network remains responsive and adaptive to changes and thereby enhancing both reliability and performance for all users (Tanenbaum & Wetherall, 2019).
For TechNet Solutions, whose network spans a central office and multiple regional branches, dynamic routing protocols provide seamless data flow management across these sites. As new branches, devices, or users are introduced, the protocols automatically adjust to incorporate these additions, preventing network congestion and maintaining efficient data transmission. This scalability is crucial for supporting TechNet’s ongoing expansion, as it allows for network growth without the risks of downtime or data loss that can occur with static routing. Furthermore, in the event of link failures, dynamic protocols can quickly re-route data through alternative paths, preserving uninterrupted connectivity, which is essential for a company with geographically dispersed operations.

Comparison of OSPF and EIGRP
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state protocol that effectively calculates the shortest path based on the network’s topology, assigning cost values to each link in the process. This protocol is designed to recalculate routes dynamically whenever there is a change in the network, employing Dijkstra's algorithm to ensure optimal path selection. One of the primary strengths of OSPF lies in its hierarchical structure, which allows it to operate efficiently in larger networks by grouping routers into areas. This not only reduces the overhead on individual routers but also minimizes the processing power and memory requirements, making it particularly suitable for extensive infrastructures like that of TechNet Solutions (Forouzan, 2020).

In contrast, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a distance-vector protocol developed by Cisco that integrates characteristics of link-state protocols. EIGRP uses a hybrid approach to determine the best path by considering various metrics, including delay, bandwidth, load, and reliability. This flexibility enables EIGRP to adapt to changing network conditions effectively, resulting in highly efficient route selection. A notable advantage of EIGRP is its rapid convergence, which significantly reduces downtime when a link fails or experiences changes in the network topology (Kurose & Ross, 2021). However, because EIGRP is a proprietary protocol, its use may be limited in environments where a variety of router brands are deployed, potentially posing challenges for TechNet Solutions if they expand their network infrastructure.

When comparing the two protocols, it becomes clear that OSPF’s open-standard nature provides greater compatibility across different vendor equipment, making it an ideal choice for networks that require interoperability. OSPF’s hierarchical design also enhances its scalability, allowing for better management of larger networks by segregating traffic and reducing broadcast domains. Conversely, EIGRP's rapid convergence can be a significant advantage in dynamic environments where network conditions frequently change, as it allows for swift adjustments and minimizes disruption to network operations.

Recommended Protocol: OSPF
Based on the analysis of OSPF and EIGRP, I recommend OSPF as the optimal routing protocol for TechNet Solutions. Both protocols exhibit rapid convergence and efficient routing capabilities; however, OSPF stands out due to its open-standard nature, which ensures compatibility across various router brands. This compatibility is particularly beneficial as TechNet Solutions continues to expand its network infrastructure, as it allows for the integration of equipment from different vendors without the limitations associated with proprietary protocols like EIGRP.

Moreover, OSPF is designed to manage large, hierarchical networks effectively, which aligns seamlessly with TechNet’s multi-branch structure. Its ability to group routers into areas reduces network overhead, optimizing performance by minimizing unnecessary routing updates and conserving processing resources on individual routers. This scalability is crucial for TechNet, as it not only accommodates the current network design but also facilitates future growth, allowing for additional branches and devices to be integrated with minimal disruption.

In conclusion, OSPF is the best fit for TechNet Solutions because it offers the flexibility, performance, and scalability essential for a growing network. Its efficient routing capabilities, open-standard design, and ability to effectively manage a hierarchical network structure make it an ideal choice for supporting the company’s current needs and future expansion. By choosing OSPF, TechNet Solutions will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges that come with network growth, ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance across all its branches. This decision sets a solid foundation for the company as it continues to develop and adapt in a rapidly changing technological landscape.

1.3. Developing an Effective Incident Response Process for Security Breaches at TechNet Solutions
To effectively address and mitigate security breaches, TechNet Solutions is on the right track in wanting to establish a structured incident response process. This framework is essential for taking swift, coordinated action in the face of incidents, minimizing damage, and ensuring a secure recovery. The process encompasses several critical stages, including preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and reflection, each of which plays a vital role in managing threats. By implementing this comprehensive response system, TechNet Solutions will not only reduce the impact of security incidents but also enhance its resilience against future attacks. The steps below outline each stage of the process and highlight the importance of adopting this structured approach.
1.	Preparation: Preparation is the foundation of incident response, setting up the organization to handle security breaches effectively. This step includes implementing critical security policies, such as an Access Control Policy, which regulates employee access to sensitive data, often using a role-based access model to minimize unauthorized access (ISO/IEC 27001:2013). In addition, a Password Management Policy enforces the use of complex, regularly updated passwords to further secure network access (Kaspersky, 2021). Preparation also encompasses employee training programs, such as phishing awareness training, which equips staff to identify and avoid common threats, supported by periodic simulations to reinforce awareness (SANS, 2022). Clearly defined team roles and responsibilities are essential for coordination, designating specific tasks for Incident Response Team members to manage aspects such as containment and communication. Effective preparation entails setting up secure communication channels, like encrypted messaging, for internal coordination during a breach and defining external communication protocols to manage information shared with clients and regulatory bodies. Developing an Incident Response Plan (IRP) detailing specific procedures for each response stage, including tailored playbooks for incidents like ransomware or denial-of-service attacks, is the final component. This comprehensive approach ensures that TechNet Solutions is fully equipped to act quickly, minimizing incident impact and securing faster recovery.


2.	Detection and Analysis: This critical step involves identifying and assessing potential threats to determine the nature and severity of incidents. Continuous network monitoring through tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS) and antivirus software helps identify suspicious activity or abnormal patterns (Gartner, 2020). Once a potential threat is flagged, it is analyzed to confirm if it is a genuine security incident. Quick, accurate analysis is crucial, enabling the response team to categorize the incident, prioritize resources, and decide on containment strategies. Documentation of initial findings is essential for informing subsequent steps and facilitating post-incident analysis, enhancing the team's understanding of the breach and improving responses to future incidents. A well-executed detection and analysis phase is vital for a timely, effective response, helping TechNet Solutions limit potential damage and speed up recovery.


3.	Containment: This vital step focuses on limiting the impact of a security breach while ensuring that systems remain operational as much as possible. Containment strategies typically involve immediate actions to isolate affected systems, such as disconnecting compromised devices from the network or blocking malicious traffic at the firewall (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2021). These quick measures prevent further damage and protect unaffected systems from being compromised. Long-term containment involves implementing permanent fixes, such as applying patches, changing access credentials, or strengthening security configurations to safeguard against similar threats in the future. Effective containment strategies minimize data loss, reduce downtime, and stabilize the network environment, allowing TechNet Solutions to maintain business continuity while preparing for a thorough investigation and recovery of systems.

4.	Eradication: This step involves eliminating the root cause of the security incident and ensuring that any vulnerabilities exploited during the breach are addressed. Once the incident is confirmed and contained, the response team works to remove malware, unauthorized users, or compromised accounts from the network. This may include deleting malicious files, applying security patches, or changing passwords to secure affected accounts (Chuvakin et al., 2021). Conducting a thorough investigation during this phase is essential to identify all potential threats and ensure complete removal. Additionally, systems should be verified and monitored post-eradication to confirm that threats do not resurface. By effectively addressing the underlying issues, TechNet Solutions can prevent future incidents and strengthen its overall security posture, ensuring that the organization is better prepared for similar threats.

5.	Recovery: This crucial phase focuses on restoring systems and services to normal operations while ensuring that the network is secure. The response team works to recover affected systems from clean backups, reinstalling software and applying necessary updates to eliminate lingering threats. Monitoring the systems closely for signs of weakness or residual issues ensures that they function correctly and securely before being fully restored to production use (Palo Alto Networks, 2020). Communication with stakeholders throughout the recovery process is essential, providing updates on the status of systems and expected timelines for full restoration. This transparency helps maintain trust and confidence among employees, clients, and partners. By effectively managing the recovery phase, TechNet Solutions can minimize downtime and return to regular business operations swiftly, while reinforcing its defenses to prevent future incidents.

6.	Post-Incident Activity: This final step emphasizes the importance of learning from the incident to improve future responses. After recovery, the incident response team conducts a thorough review of the entire incident, analyzing what occurred, how it was managed, and the effectiveness of the response strategies employed. This phase often includes a comprehensive debriefing session where team members discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, documenting key findings and lessons learned (NIST, 2020). The organization should also update its Incident Response Plan (IRP) based on these insights, ensuring that policies, procedures, and training reflect the most current threat landscape and response strategies. Communicating findings to all stakeholders promotes awareness and understanding of the incident's impact and the measures taken to address it. By focusing on continuous improvement through post-incident activities, TechNet Solutions can enhance its security posture, refine its incident response capabilities, and better prepare for future incidents.
By implementing these steps, TechNet Solutions can develop a robust and systematic incident response process that improves its capacity to identify, manage, and recover from security breaches, thereby safeguarding its assets and maintaining the trust of its clients.
